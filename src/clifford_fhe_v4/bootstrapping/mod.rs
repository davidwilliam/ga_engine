//! Bootstrap operations for packed multivectors
//!
//! V4 bootstrap will use the same CoeffToSlot/EvalMod/SlotToCoeff structure as V3,
//! but operating on packed ciphertexts with 8× memory reduction.
//!
//! TODO: Implement after Phase 1 (packing) and Phase 2 (geometric ops) are complete.
//! This module will be implemented in Phase 3 (Weeks 4-5).
